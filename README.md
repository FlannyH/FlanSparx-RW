# FlanSparx-RW
This is a rewritten version of FlanSparx, a Game Boy project I'm making for fun.
It's a topdown shooter based on the Sparx Worlds from Spyro: Year of the Dragon on PS1.
The goal is to fully implement all the Sparx levels from the original game, and make it run at 60 fps

The old code was one big spaghetti, and impossible to work with. I learned a lot over the past few months, so it should end up becoming a lot better now.
